# ToDoApp
To-Do List in HTML, JavaScript and CSS
To run the code you will need to run de LogIn.html file which will show a preview login page where the given username is "123" and the password "abc". 
You will succesfully login by clicking the "LogIn" button, or by pressing the enter key.

After, you will be redirected to the To-Do List. You can type the item you want to add in the bar below,
and pressing by the enter key or clicking the "plus" button, the item will be added to the list. 
That item can also be deleted from the list if you click the "trash" icon.

At the top right there is a "refresh" icon which refreshes the page, as well as the to-do list.

There is also a pencil icon which was going to edit the selected item from the list. However, I
didn't have time to finish such process.
